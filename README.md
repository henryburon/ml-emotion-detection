### Machine Learning Model for Emotion Classification

We developed 3 machine learning models for this task:
1. Logistic Regression Classifier with an LBFGS Optimization Algorithm and OvA Multiclass Strategy
2. SVM using Radial Basis Function (RBF)
3. Logistic Regression using ReLU and Sigmoid with binary-cross entropy loss. OvA Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Implement on pictures

1. **Load your images**
* Directory: images/unknown/original

2. **Run model**
* Ensure that the "logistic_regression/trained_model/7class_3ksample_42%.pk1" model is loaded
* Python file: 3_implement_picture.py

3. **View classified images**
* They will appear in: images/unknown/classified

### Implement on live video

1. **Run model**
* Ensure desired model is loaded
* Python file: 4_implement_video.py
