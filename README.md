### Machine Learning Model for Emotion Classification

Logistic Regression vs SVM vs CNN

We developed three machine learning models.

### Implement on pictures

1. **Load your images**
* Directory: images/unknown/original

2. **Run model**
* Ensure that the 'logistic_regression/trained_model/7class_3ksample_42%.pk1 is loaded
* Python file: 3_implement_picture.py

3. **View classified images**
* They will appear in: images/unknown/classified

### Implement on live video

1. **Run model**
* Ensure desired model is loaded
* Python file: 4_implement_video.py
